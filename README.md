## Goal

Goal of the project is a multi artist collaboration project that shares the revenus of token sales:

1. 70% for Artists
1. 20% into a Pool, claimable by Artists
1. 8% into a Pool, claimable by Token Owner
1. 2% for Admin

## Reponsibilities

1. Another contract mints the Art
1. Royalty on mint and payments are handled somewhere else (Marketplace)
1. **This** Contract receives the royalty from mint and splits the revenue
1. Another contract is responsible for the Pool-Management

   * provide access to the Collectors/audience

1. NFTContract
